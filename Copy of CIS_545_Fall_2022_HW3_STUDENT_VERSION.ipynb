In this homework you will master Spark SQL. By the end, you'll be a star (not that you aren't already one). Over the next few days you will be using an EMR cluster to use Spark to manipulate the datasets about Amazon products and their reviews. \n","\n","## The Necessary Notes and Nags\n","Before we begin here are some important notes to keep in mind,\n","\n","\n","1.   **IMPORTANT!** I said it twice, it's really important. In this homework, we will be using AWS resources. You are given a quota ($100) to use for the entirety of the homework. There is a small chance you will use all this money, however it is important that at the end of every session, you **shut down your EMR cluster**.\n","2.   **Be sure you use Google Colab for this Homework** since we must connect to the EMR cluster and local Jupyter will have issues doing that. Using a Google Colab Notebook with an EMR cluster has two important abnormalities:\n","    * The first line of any cell in which you will use the spark session must be `%%spark`. Notice that all cells below have this.\n","    * You will, unfortunately, not be able to stop a cell while it is running. If you wish to do so, you will need to restart your cluster. See the Setup EMR Document for reference.\n","3.   You are **required** to use Spark SQL queries to handle the data in the assignment. Mastering SQL is more beneficial than being able to use Spark commands (functions) as it will show up in more areas of programming and data science/analytics than just Spark. Use the following [function list](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#) to see all the SQL functions avaliable in Spark.\n","4.   Throughout the homework you will be manipulating Spark dataframes (sdfs). We do not specify any ordering on the final output. You are welcome to order your final tables in whatever way you deem fit. We will conduct our own ordering when we grade.\n","5. Based on the challenges you've faced in the previous homework, we are including information on the expected schema of your results.  Apache Spark is very fiddly but we hope this will help.\n","6. There are portions of this homework that are _very_ hard. We urge you start early to come to office hours and get help if you get stuck. But don't worry, I can see the future, and you've all got this.\n","\n","With that said, let's dive in.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7XEqGpEGBWs5"},"source":["## Step 0: Set up EMR\n","\n","Follow the [AWS Academy Getting Started](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JPitLGaorjTbXjGsaoIHcLTu2cj8rjm5UNr9bSpZ72k/edit?usp=sharing) instructions.\n","\n","Move on to Step 0.1 after you have completed all the steps in the document.\n","\n","![ACME GIANT RUBBER BAND](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRqbJh7UMAE2z4o?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5iBPXxgAdXkv"},"source":["### Step 0.1: The Superfluous Setup\n","\n","Run the following two cells.
